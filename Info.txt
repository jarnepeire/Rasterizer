A quick overview of implementations in the Exam Project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
General requirements:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Week 6-9 Software Rasterizer assignments
- Week 10-12 DirectX assignments
- Swappable Software- and DirectX-Rasterizer
- Swappable texture sampling (DirectX only)
- Swappable transparancy (DirectX only)
- Swappable cull modes (both SRAS and DirectX) 
- Frustum Culling
- Frame rate indepent camera motion
- 1 renderer object that manages both rendering techniques
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra's: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SceneManager system (makes it possible to swap between scenes in realtime, check key binds)
- Frame rate independent game loop (capped fps and real FPS outputted to window)
	-> Frame rate indepent camera motion because of this too
- Light manager and multiple lights support in DirectX shaders
- PBR support, used a mesh and textures I made for my "3D For Games 2" exam assignment
	-> Used Lambert Cook Torrance BRDF for both SRAS and DirectX
	-> You can swap to "Custom Scene" to see this for yourself
- Attempt at Clipping (does not interfere with the regular assignments)
	-> Turned off (only simple frustum culling is being used in SRAS) 
	-> For now only an attempt is made to clip triangles when going out the left side of the screen
	-> Has issues where it starts clipping too early when only 1 vertex is out of bounds
	-> Has issues where it starts clipping when 2 vertices are out of bounds

Clipping code -> Triangle.cpp at line 340
In the Renderer.cpp you'll find some other check if we're rendering clipped triangles or not -> line 244

Key Bind Inputs:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(you can find these printed in the console at the start too, press "I" to re-output it)
